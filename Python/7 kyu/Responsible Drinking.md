## Responsible Drinking

Welcome to the Codewars Bar!

Codewars Bar recommends you drink 1 glass of water per standard drink so you're not hungover tomorrow morning.

Your fellow coders have bought you several drinks tonight in the form of a string. Return a string suggesting how many glasses of water you should drink to not be hungover.


---

### Given Code


```python
def hydrate(drink_string):
    pass
```

---

### Solution


```python
def hydrate(drink_string):

    water = sum([int(i) for i in drink_string if i.isnumeric()])
    return f"{water} glass of water" if water == 1 else f"{water} glasses of water"
```
