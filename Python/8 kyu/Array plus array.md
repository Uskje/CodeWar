## Array plus array


I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

### Given Code


```python
def array_plus_array(arr1,arr2):
    pass
```

---

### Solution


```python
def array_plus_array(arr1,arr2):
    return sum(arr1 + arr2)
```
