## Counting sheep...


Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).
The correct answer would be 17.

Hint: Don't forget to check for bad values like null/undefined

def count_sheeps(sheep):
  # TODO May the force be with you

```
